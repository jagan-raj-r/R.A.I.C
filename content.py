# How R.A.I.C Works - Technical Methodology

Understanding how R.A.I.C evaluates your prompts helps you interpret the results and improve your AI interactions.

### **Detection Method: Zero-Shot Classification**

R.A.I.C uses **ML-based zero-shot classification** - a powerful technique that can evaluate text without needing specific training examples.

**What This Means:**
- No pre-defined rules or keyword lists
- Uses semantic understanding of language
- Can detect nuanced ethical issues
- Adapts to context and meaning

### **The Model Behind R.A.I.C**

**Model:** `valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-1`
- **Type:** Zero-shot text classification
- **Architecture:** Distilled BART (efficient transformer)
- **Training:** Multi-genre Natural Language Inference
- **Advantage:** Fast, accurate, runs on CPU

### **How Evaluation Works: Step-by-Step**

#### **Step 1: Prompt Input**
You enter your prompt → R.A.I.C analyzes it

#### **Step 2: Semantic Evaluation**
Your prompt is evaluated against **70+ semantic labels** across **6 categories**:
- Fairness & Bias Prevention (~15 labels)
- Safety & Reliability (~14 labels)
- Privacy & Security (~12 labels)
- Inclusiveness & Accessibility (~11 labels)
- Transparency & Explainability (~13 labels)
- Accountability & Governance (~12 labels)
- Plus positive "Responsible & Safe" indicators (~14 labels)

#### **Step 3: Score Aggregation**
- Each label gets a confidence score (0-100%)
- Category scores = maximum score among related labels
- This captures the strongest signal in each category

#### **Step 4: Decision Making**
- **Highest scoring category wins** the classification
- **Threshold:** Violations flagged if score > 30%
- **Confidence levels:**
  - 🔴 High (>70%): Strong detection
  - 🟡 Medium (50-70%): Moderate confidence
  - 🟢 Low (<50%): Weak signal

#### **Step 5: Hybrid Enhancement**
Additional **keyword detection** for obvious violations:
- Explicit bias terms → Boost fairness violation score
- Direct harmful content → Boost safety violation score

### **Understanding Your Results**

#### **What You See:**

**📊 All Category Scores**
- Every category's score displayed with visual bars
- Sorted from highest to lowest
- Helps you see close calls and runner-up issues

**🎯 Confidence Level**
- Tells you how certain the system is
- Higher confidence = more reliable detection
- Lower confidence = might need human review

**🔍 Methodology Details**
- Transparent about how decision was made
- Shows which model and process was used
- Helps you trust and understand the results

**💡 Actionable Tips**
- Links to relevant Learn content
- Suggestions for improvement
- Clear next steps

### **Key Thresholds Explained**

| Threshold | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **>70%** | High Risk - Strong violation detected | Immediate review needed |
| **55-70%** | Moderate Risk - Likely issue present | Review recommended |
| **30-55%** | Low Risk - Potential concern | Consider reviewing |
| **<30%** | Below Threshold - No violation | Approved |

### **Why Safe Prompts Might Score Lower**

You might notice that clearly safe prompts don't always score as high as expected on "Responsible & Safe." Here's why:

**The Model is Conservative:**
- Zero-shot models tend to be cautious with positive classifications
- This is intentional - better to flag for review than miss issues
- It's easier to confirm something is safe than to catch subtle violations

**Multiple Dimensions:**
- A prompt can be "safe" but still have room for improvement
- Lower scores don't always mean problems
- Check ALL category scores to get the full picture

**Ongoing Calibration:**
- We're continuously improving threshold settings
- Your feedback helps us calibrate better
- Future versions will have more accurate scoring

### **Limitations & Transparency**

**What R.A.I.C Does Well:**
✅ Detects semantic patterns and meaning
✅ Catches subtle bias and ethical issues
✅ Works across many domains and contexts
✅ Fast and efficient analysis

**Current Limitations:**
⚠️ May be overly conservative with safe content
⚠️ Context understanding has limits
⚠️ Confidence calibration needs improvement
⚠️ Can't understand very complex scenarios

**What This Means for You:**
- Use R.A.I.C as a helpful assistant, not final judge
- High confidence flags deserve attention
- Low confidence results need human review
- Combine with your own ethical judgment

### **Continuous Improvement**

R.A.I.C is evolving based on user feedback:
- Better threshold calibration
- Improved confidence scoring
- More accurate safe prompt detection
- Enhanced explanation capabilities

**Your feedback matters!** Report unexpected results to help us improve.
