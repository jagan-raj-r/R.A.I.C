**Release Date:** October 22, 2024

## 🎉 What's New

### **3-Tab Interface**
Complete redesign with dedicated tabs for better organization:
- **Audit Tool** - Main prompt auditing interface
- **How It Works** - Technical methodology and transparency
- **Learn Responsible AI** - Comprehensive educational content

### **Complete Score Transparency**
- All 7 category scores now displayed (not just the winner)
- Visual bar charts for easy comparison
- Sorted by score (highest to lowest)
- Helps users understand close calls and runner-up issues

### **Confidence Indicators**
Clear confidence levels for all results:
- **High Confidence** (>70%) - Strong detection
- **Medium Confidence** (50-70%) - Moderate certainty
- **Low Confidence** (<50%) - Weak signal

### **Professional Output**
- Removed all emojis from user-facing feedback
- Clean, text-based professional presentation
- Suitable for enterprise and academic use

### **Dedicated Methodology Section**
New "How It Works" tab explains:
- Zero-shot classification process
- Model architecture and capabilities
- Score calculation methodology
- Decision thresholds and logic
- Limitations and transparency
- Why safe prompts might score lower

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Code Optimization**
- **Reduced from 265 → 240 lines** (-9.4%)
- Modular architecture with 6 well-defined functions
- Extracted helper functions: `get_confidence_level()`, `build_scores_display()`, `build_methodology()`, `build_feedback()`
- Applied DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Better separation of concerns

### **Performance Enhancements**
- Dict comprehensions for faster execution
- Generator expressions for lower memory footprint
- Eliminated redundant computations
- Module-level constants (no recreation per call)

### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` environment variable issue
- Environment variable now set **before** importing transformers
- Resolves "hf_transfer package not available" error

### **Content Management**
- Split educational content into separate modules:
  - `HOW_IT_WORKS_CONTENT` (~4,700 characters)
  - `LEARN_CONTENT` (~19,300 characters)
- Total educational content: ~24,000 characters
- Easier to maintain and update
